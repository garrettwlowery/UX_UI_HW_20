                <p class="lead">After creating the user persona I did an heuristic evaluation on the existing Coral Reef Alliance website to see what it did well and what needed some changes. This showed that the navigation was a glaring need as it was not laid out in a order that made sense and often made navigating the site painful. The lay out of the site was also inconsistent with texts and colors not remaining the same through out all the pages and the overall lay out being cluttered on some pages with inconsistent spacing.</p>

              <p class="lead">Following the heuristic evaluation a competitor analysis was done in order to determine what other non-profits were or were not doing that would allow us to gain an advantage on them. This further backed up our heuristic evaluation by showing that some of the bigger name coral reef non profits had sites with less clutter, matching text sizes and colors throughout all their pages, as well as a navigation which allowed for easier use of the site.

                  <p class="lead">During the reserach phase a survey was also conducted to see if we could find out any quantitative data that might give us insite into how to shape the website redesign. The data showed that the majority of people surveyed did care about the coral reefs, however, they had little to no knowledge on the dangers of coral reef destruction. Nor had any of them ever donated to any non profit organization, beit about coral reefs or otherwise.</p>

                <p class="lead">Five user interviews were preformed and their data was gathered into an affinity map in order to group common themes so a better understanding of the data could be found. This turned out to be extremely valuable in backing up the data result from the survey. We were able to confirm that despite the users stating that they cared about coral reefs they knew very little about preservation efforts or the causes and effects of its destruction, nor had never donated to a non profit. However, the research also showed that the users were interested in learning more about the effects of coral reef destruction, but they did find research to be a frustrating task. This made it clear that information about coral reef destruction and it's preservation efforts needed to be clear and easy to find on the newly redesigned website.

            <p class="lead">1) Now that the research phase has been concluded the problems we were trying to solve could clearly be defined. A value proposition was created which showed the areas in which we could provide the most impact to the usability of the website. It was determined that the following features should be the focus of the redesign; </p>
            <p class="lead">2) Better calls to action in order to get the user involved with the website.</p>
            <p class="lead">3) Chunk information into smaller pieces, often the user would feel overwhelmed by the amount of information on a single page. By changing this it allowed for a more pleasurable experience.</p>
            <p class="lead">4) Immediately show ways to get involved, from our research it was evident that users wanted to get involved but were not sure how. By providing this information from the start it could increase the likelihood of the users getting involved,</p>
            <p class="lead">5) More educational tools to spread awareness. the original site mentioned educational tools, however never really gave the tools for them. This is important because later it was actually scraped as feature to focus on due to time constraints and the original site not actually focusing on this.</p>
